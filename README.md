# optimal_kmeans_clustering
The kmeans algorithm, written from scratch using python programing.
The initial centers generally use random. But this method can lead to jam at local minimum.  
Kmeans++ is use to generate the initial centers. This repository with main method, initial centers 
like: random, kmeans++ is implement from scratch without using any packages
